You can compile and run this program for three different architectures: Native,
SPARC, and MSP430. By default, a native binary will be compiled.

To build for SPARC, issue the command:
ARCH=sparc make

To build for MSP430, issue the command:
ARCH=msp430 make

You can run the compiled program by issuing the command:
ARCH=<target> make run

Replacing <target> with either ``sparc'' or ``msp430''. You will need the
msp430 simulator that comes with gdb. To run the sparc target, you will need
the qemu-sparc userland emulator.
